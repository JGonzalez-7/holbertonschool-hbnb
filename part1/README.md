# HBnB UML – Part 1

This folder contains the UML deliverables for the HBnB project (Holberton). All diagrams use Mermaid so they render visually in Markdown preview.

## Files
- `high-level_package_diagram.md` – three-layer architecture showing Presentation, Facade, Business Logic, and Persistence.
- `class_diagram_for_business_logic_layer.md` – class diagram for the core domain models; `business-logic-layer-class-diagram.md` is a duplicate reference.
- `user-registration.md` – sequence diagram for creating a user.
- `place-creation.md` – sequence diagram for creating a place with optional amenities.
- `review-submission.md` – sequence diagram for submitting a review.
- `fetch-List-of-places.md` – sequence diagram for listing/filtering places.
- `sequence_diagrams_for_api_calls.md` – collected sequence diagrams in one file.
- `doc_compilation.md` – compiled technical document that embeds the diagrams.

## Usage
Open any file in a Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid to see the rendered diagrams. If Mermaid rendering is disabled, enable it in your viewer or use an online Mermaid renderer.
